# Predict-the-Flat-Resale-Prices-in-Singapore

Investing in Flats is the biggest investment for most households in cities like Singapore which is very
small but heavily urbanised. Therefore, being able to accurately value the flat prices will not only
facilitate market transactions by providing valuable guidance for all market participants (be it home
owners, home buyers, landlords, tenants or banks that underwrite mortgages), but also provide
useful insights for policy makers and government authorities in understanding the current state of
the economy.
In this competition, you are expected to create an analytical and modelling framework to predict the
flat resale prices based on the quantitative and qualitative features provided in the dataset while
answering other questions too cited below.
II. The datasets are provided as cited below :
To build the model and tune the model & visualization
i. train1.csv
ii. train2.csv
iii. train3.csv
iv. building_to_mrt_distance.csv (distance in meters) - Can be used for both train and test

## Main Task:
● create an analytical and modelling framework to predict the flat resale prices using only train data.
● create an analytical and modelling framework to predict the flat resale prices using train data and buliding data.
(building data is used to do clustering and adding the cluster to main dataset and bulding model)

## Evaluation Metric:
● ‘ RMSE’ as the error metric for regression task to tune the model.
